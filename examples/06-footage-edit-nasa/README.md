# 06 · Footage edit: an interview tightened, captioned and reframed (Reels + 16:9)

![poster](poster.jpg)

**Videos:**
- [`final.mp4`](https://github.com/Mudassir-Kidwai/video-creator-crew-examples/releases/download/examples-media-v1/06-footage-edit-nasa--final.mp4): 9:16 for Reels · repo copy at 720x1280 (the master is 1080x1920) · 30 fps · 72.3 s · 16.5 MB · -14.0 LUFS · bold-pop captions burned in
- [`final-16x9.mp4`](https://github.com/Mudassir-Kidwai/video-creator-crew-examples/releases/download/examples-media-v1/06-footage-edit-nasa--final-16x9.mp4): 16:9 · 1920x1080 · 30 fps · 72.3 s · 17.6 MB · -14.0 LUFS · phrase-level clean captions burned in, with [`final-16x9.srt`](final-16x9.srt) as a sidecar

These are the round-3 versions, after two critic reviews. See *Review round* below.

## The request

> "Cut the ums and long pauses out of this interview clip, add captions, and make a vertical 9:16
> version for Reels plus a 16:9 version"

**Mode:** quick. No questions were asked. The opening line stated the assumptions: keep every
sentence in order, remove fillers, shorten pauses over 0.5 s to 0.3 s, use face-tracked 9:16 with
bold-pop captions for Reels and 16:9 with clean captions, apply a light grade, master at -14 LUFS,
and add no music because the piece is led by speech.

**The "user's footage"** is an 81 s excerpt of a real public-domain NASA interview. It was found
with `showtime assets media search` (NASA source, video). It is a sit-down interview with astronaut
Christina Koch, recorded in 2023 for the Artemis II crew announcement, taken from source 1:01-2:22
of NASA/JSC item
[`jsc2023m000095`](https://images.nasa.gov/details/jsc2023m000095_Christina_Koch_Artemis_II_Crew_Announcement_Resource_Reel-social).
See *Sources and license* below.

## What it demonstrates

- **Editing by transcript.** The edit is driven by a word-level transcript (Whisper large-v3-turbo,
  262 words). The cut list comes from `edit cut`. The hand edits to the EDL were the punch-ins and
  reframe splits, the grade strength, the caption options, in round 2 a 0.17 s pad before
  "and readiness" and a 0.22 s tail trim, and in round 3 a fixed crop on one punch-in range.
- **Fillers and pauses.** The filler pass ran and found **0 ums**. Parakeet, the engine that keeps
  disfluencies, confirmed it. NASA's interview was cleanly delivered, so nothing was invented or
  forced. The pause pass removed the lead-in, the tail and five pauses of 0.6-1.3 s. The clip went
  from **81.0 s to 72.3 s (-11 %)**. A Parakeet re-transcription of the final still has all 262
  words, so no word was clipped at a cut.
- **Hidden jump cuts.** Alternate ranges punch in to 1.2x, so each of the 5 real cuts reads as a
  change of framing. The last 35 s (one unbroken answer) also changes framing 4 times without a
  cut: the range is split into contiguous, frame-aligned source ranges that alternate between 1.0x
  and 1.2x, with each join placed in a gap between words. These joins carry no audio fade, so the
  room tone runs on unbroken (see *Review round*). See `project/review/scenes.jpg`.
- **Face-tracked 9:16 reframe.** YuNet face tracking with a dead zone keeps her centred without
  drift. On one punch-in (0:37.1-0:42.1) the dead zone held the crop on where she started, which
  left her at about 60 % of the width, so that range uses a fixed crop on her face instead
  (`"fit": "cover", "focus": {"x": 0.503}`).
- **Caption placement is a judgment call, and it was checked in the frames.** In the first draft,
  bold-pop's default lower third sat exactly on the flight-suit patch and name tag. The captions
  moved to `position: middle`, on the collar just under the chin, and in round 2 grew to about an
  84 px cap height (`size` 0.135, `chars` 16 so the longest line still fits). In round 3 the
  bold-pop chunks come from `boldpop_captions.py` (showtime's own bold-pop pass, plus a rule that
  no chunk is shorter than 0.20 s). The 16:9 version uses sentence-case phrase captions in the
  lower 8 %, and every caption change lands on the cut, not 3 frames after it.
- **Light grade.** `teal-orange` at strength 0.3. `grade --compare` stills showed that
  `--grade auto` lifted the low-key backdrop and flattened her face, so auto was rejected.
- **Loudness.** Mastered once on the program to -14 LUFS with a -1 dBTP ceiling.

```

`export_repo.py` calls `st.deliver.exports.export_one` with the Reels/YouTube target set to CRF 22
and a 1.85 Mbps video cap (160 kbps audio), keeping showtime's loudnorm, BT.709 tags and faststart.
It is not a raw ffmpeg call. It exists because `deliver exports` has no size-budget option. The
9:16 repo copy is 720x1280: at this bitrate a 1080x1920 frame smeared skin, and the face-tracked
crop holds only about 608x1080 real pixels anyway. The full-quality masters from `deliver exports`
(1080x1920 and 1920x1080) are what you would upload.

`rechunk_captions.py` regroups the same output-timeline words into phrase cues with a small dynamic
program: at most 42 characters per line on 16:9 (32 on 9:16) and 2 lines per cue, breaks preferred
after sentences, clauses and pauses, no line or cue ending on a function word ("the", "of", "to",
"when" ...) or splitting a name when another break fits, and each cue held at least 1.0 s. A cue
that would start up to 250 ms after a cut or reframe starts on it instead. It writes the SRT, and the ASS through showtime's own `captions.to_ass` in the `clean` style.
It exists because showtime's grouping split this fast speaker into 80-200 ms one-word cues (see
*Review round*).

`boldpop_captions.py` runs showtime's bold-pop grouping unchanged, then merges any chunk shorter
than 0.20 s with a neighbour ("OUR" joins "SKILLS"; "THAT" takes the next "THAT"). It writes the
ASS the 9:16 EDL burns through `"subtitles"`.

## Timings

Measured on a 6-core Intel Mac (x64) whose CPU was shared with about 3 other render jobs.

| Step | Time |
|---|---|
| NASA fetch (309 MB, `large` rendition) | 12 s |
| Excerpt render (81 s clip, one segment) | 159 s |
| Transcribe, Whisper large-v3-turbo (81 s of audio, model load 16 s) | 165 s |
| Transcribe, Parakeet cross-check | 81 s (20-87 s for the 72 s final) |
| Preview renders (720p): pass 1 / 2 / 3 | 169 s / 104 s / 117 s |
| Round 1 finals: 9:16 / 16:9 | 283 s / 328 s (one earlier 245 s 16:9 render was redone, see below) |
| Round 2 finals: 9:16 (10 segments, 2 cached) / 16:9 | 258 s / 161 s |
| Round 3 finals: 9:16 / 16:9 (10 segments, 5 cached each) | 195 s / 104 s |
| Phrase re-chunk (both EDLs) | about 1 s |
| `deliver exports` reels / youtube | 92 s / 116 s (round 3: 65 s / 56 s) |
| Repo-size exports | 34-65 s each |
| `qa` (masters / repo copies) | 22-28 s / 69-75 s |
| `review-pack` | about 36 s each |

## QA summary (round 3)

- **9:16 master (`<job>/final-3.mp4`, 1080x1920, 72.27 s), verdict WARN**: 0 fail, 2 warn. File
  h264 High, yuv420p, 30 fps, faststart, BT.709. Loudness -14.0 LUFS, true peak -1.4 dBTP. No
  silent gaps, black or frozen stretches.
  - `WARN upscale`: the source is enlarged 1.78x, or 2.13x on the 1.2x punch-in ranges. That is
    unavoidable when a 1080p source fills a 1080x1920 frame, and NASA's original is also 1080p.
    Round 2 raised the punch-in from 1.1x (1.96x) to 1.2x on purpose, so the framing changes read as
    deliberate.
  - `WARN caption_fast` on the SRT sidecar: phrase cues run over 20 characters/s in her fastest
    passages (18 of 35 cues). She averages about 19 characters/s across the whole clip, so verbatim
    phrase captions can't all stay under 20. Round 3 made the 9:16 sidecar favour whole phrases
    over reading speed, which added cues over 20 (10 of 28 in round 2). The round-1 SRT passed this
    check only by splitting such passages into 1-2 word flashes, which the rule exempts.
- **16:9 master (`<job>/final-16x9-3.mp4`), verdict WARN**: 0 fail, 1 warn (`caption_fast`, same
  cause, 10 of 25 cues). Enlargement: 1.2x on the punch-in ranges (under qa's 1.5x limit), 1.0x
  elsewhere. Captions: 25 cues, shortest 1.12 s, none under 1 s (round 1: 85 cues, 8 under 200 ms).
- **Shipped copies, verdict WARN for both.** `final.mp4` against reels: `resolution` (the 720x1280
  repo copy, see above) and `caption_fast`. `final-16x9.mp4` against youtube: `caption_fast`.
  qa measures both at -14.0 LUFS / -1.5 dBTP.
- **Words:** a Parakeet re-transcription of `final-3.mp4` has all 262 words.
- **Review packs:** `<job>/review/round-1/` (the first critic's input), `<job>/review/round-2/` and
  `<job>/review/16x9/round-1/` (the second critic's input), and `<job>/review/round-3/` (built with
  `--force-round` for the shipped cut sheet; no critic reviewed round 3).
- **Not checked:** listening. Audio was judged from the waveform, the loudness graph, RMS at each
  join and a re-transcription.

## Review round

Round 1 was self-reviewed and judged "ship". A separate critic then reviewed the round-1 pack plus
the 16:9 and the SRTs. Its verdict was **ship after fixes**: no blockers, 4 should-fix items and 6
polish items. Each item was checked against the frames or files before anything changed. All of
them were applied in one re-render per aspect. The log is in `<job>/work/feedback.md`.

| # | Finding (time) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 16:9 captions and both SRTs flash 1-2 words: "want" for 80 ms at 0:21.6; 8 and 11 cues under 200 ms | Phrase cues from `rechunk_captions.py`: 25 on 16:9 and 28 in the 9:16 SRT, each held at least 1.12 s. The 16:9 burns them through the EDL's `subtitles` |
| 2 | No framing change from 0:36.9 to the end (35 s) | 4 reframe-only changes at 42.07, 48.33, 55.07 and 65.03 s, with no cut and no time removed |
| 3 | The Reels copy reads as current news, but the interview is from 2023 | `share.txt` Reels line now says "(2023 interview)"; the on-screen tag was optional and was not added |
| 4 | README said the insignia is never a thumbnail element, but the poster shows the patch | Claim reworded (see *Sources and license*); the poster frame is unchanged |
| 5 | 0.17 s beat before "and readiness" (0:12.3) | Range 3 now starts 0.17 s earlier, which leaves about 0.34 s of silence |
| 6 | 1.1x punch-in reads as a jump cut (0:19.4, 0:36.9) | 1.2x |
| 7 | Bold-pop cap height about 65 px | About 84 px (`size` 0.135, `chars` 16) |
| 8 | Repo 9:16 copy soft at 1080x1920 and 1.87 Mbps | Repo copy exported at 720x1280 with the same cap |
| 9 | Last frame has her eyes closed (0:72.3) | Tail trimmed 0.22 s; it now ends on eyes open and a half-smile |
| 10 | README cited a `scenes.jpg` that isn't in the example | Shipped as `project/review/scenes.jpg` |

**What the fixes cost:**
- The upscale went from 1.96x to 2.13x on the punch-in ranges.
- The honest `caption_fast` WARN replaced a PASS that the one-word flashes had earned by
  exploiting the rule's exemption.
- The shipped 9:16 copy now carries a `resolution` WARN.
- Two bold-pop chunks ("OUR" at 53.3 s and "THAT" at 61.2 s) lasted 0.15-0.16 s, shorter than
  round 1's 0.20 s minimum (fixed in round 3).
- Each reframe-only join had a 30 ms audio fade at both edges, which dipped the room tone for
  about 20 ms (fixed in round 3).

### Round 3

A second critic reviewed the round-2 pack, the 16:9 pack and the SRTs. Its verdict was again
**ship after fixes**: no blockers, 1 should-fix and 7 polish items. Each was checked against the
files or frames first; all were applied. The before/after stills are in the job's `round3/`
folder.

| # | Finding (time) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (should-fix) | README's 16:9 QA line said "No enlargement", but the 16:9 punch-ins are 1.2x | Reworded: 1.2x on the punch-in ranges (under qa's 1.5x limit), 1.0x elsewhere |
| 2 | 16:9 captions change 100 ms after the cuts at 4.43, 26.10 and 37.07 (old text for 3 frames on the new shot) | A cue that would start up to 250 ms after a cut or reframe now starts on it, and the previous cue ends there. At 0:37.1 the new shot now opens on "When I think about the Artemis II crew," |
| 3 | Reframe-only joins at 42.07, 48.33, 55.07 and 65.03 dip the room tone 14-18 dB for about 20 ms | Fixed in showtime: `edit render` no longer fades the edges between ranges that play one source continuously. Measured in 10 ms windows: the output now stays within 2 dB of the source at each join (round 2: 14-17 dB low) |
| 4 | 9:16 SRT splits phrases ("walls of / my bedroom", "on the / Artemis II", "can be the / way") | Line and cue breaks avoid function words and names. The 9:16 sidecar uses more, shorter cues (35, shortest 1.08 s), e.g. "on the Artemis II / mission to the moon." |
| 5 | 9:16 1.2x range at 0:37.1-0:42.1 is off-centre: face at about 60 %, name tag cut ("KOC") | Fixed crop on her face for that range (both aspects). The name tag now fits the frame |
| 6 | Bold-pop "OUR" (0.16 s) and "THAT" (0.15 s) | "OUR SKILLS" / "REALLY" and "THAT THAT" / "COMPLEMENTS"; every other chunk is unchanged; shortest now 0.20 s |
| 7 | `share.txt` cover text "ALWAYS DREAMED OF" doesn't match the frame ("ALWAYS DREAMED") | `share.txt` now says "ALWAYS DREAMED" |
| 8 | qa of the 16:9 also read the 9:16 SRT | Logged as a showtime issue (qa should read only the video's own sidecar) |

Round 3 was not reviewed again: review.md allows two critic rounds.

## What went wrong on the way

- The first 16:9 final burned captions mid-frame. `edit render --captions clean` replaces the
  style but keeps the EDL's `position: middle` from the 9:16 plan. The fix was a separate
  `edl-16x9.json`, and it cost one 245 s render.
- The first two footage candidates were 79-minute satellite "live shots" (3+ GB). Search results
  show no duration or size, so each candidate's metadata was checked by hand.
- The round-1 self-review missed the caption flashes. `review-pack` packs only the latest final,
  qa's caption check passed them, and the 16:9 was never looked at frame by frame. The critic found
  them.
- The first split of the last range at 47.45 s overlapped the previous range by 10 ms, because
  each range's end is snapped to whole frames from its own start. The joins were re-set to
  frame-aligned times before rendering.

## Files

- `final.mp4`, `final.srt`: the Reels version (720x1280 repo copy) and its phrase-level SRT
  (optional for Reels; the captions are burned in).
- `final-16x9.mp4`, `final-16x9.srt`: the 16:9 version and its sidecar for YouTube/LinkedIn.
- `poster.jpg`: the frame at 0:25.5 ("ALWAYS DREAMED"), 1080x1920.
- `share.txt`: Reels and YouTube copy, plus the credit line.
- `credits.txt`: the source credit and NASA usage notes.
- `project/edit/edl.json`: the 9:16 EDL, and `project/edit/captions-916.ass`, the bold-pop file it
  burns. `project/edit/edl-16x9.json` is the 16:9 EDL, and `project/edit/captions-16x9.ass` is the
  caption file it burns.
- `project/edit/transcripts/koch-interview.json`: the word-level transcript.
- `project/edit/takes_packed.md`: the packed read of the transcript.
- `project/raw/excerpt/edl.json`: how the 81 s clip was cut from NASA's reel.
- `project/raw/*.license.json`: the license record from the fetch (sha256, URLs).
- `project/rechunk_captions.py`: the phrase-level caption chunker.
- `project/boldpop_captions.py`: the bold-pop pass with the 0.20 s chunk floor.
- `project/export_repo.py`: the repo-size export.
- `project/review/scenes.jpg`: the round-3 cut sheet (every scene middle, and each cut at -0.1 s,
  midpoint and +0.2 s).

The source media is not committed. To rebuild, re-fetch it with the `assets media fetch` line
above, render the excerpt EDL to `project/raw/koch-interview.mp4`, run `boldpop_captions.py` on
`edl.json` and `rechunk_captions.py` on `edl-16x9.json`, then `showtime edit render` each EDL. The transcript cache is keyed by content, so
the `transcribe` step re-uses the committed transcript only when the rendered clip is identical;
otherwise re-run `transcribe`.

## Sources and license

- **Footage:** "Christina Koch Artemis II Crew Announcement Resource Reel", NASA/JSC, 2023 (NASA
  Image and Video Library item `jsc2023m000095_Christina_Koch_Artemis_II_Crew_Announcement_Resource_Reel-social`),
  https://images.nasa.gov/details/jsc2023m000095_Christina_Koch_Artemis_II_Crew_Announcement_Resource_Reel-social.
  NASA's item description says the reel "includes interview footage and b-roll recorded in 2023".
  Only the interview portion (1:01-2:22) is used. She speaks about the mission as upcoming, so the
  post copy says "2023 interview".
- **License:** NASA-produced media, public domain (not subject to US copyright), under NASA's media
  usage guidelines: https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-brand-center/images-and-media/. No attribution is
  legally required; it is given anyway.
- **No endorsement implied.** NASA did not make, review or endorse this edit or showtime. The NASA
  insignia appears only as the patch on her flight suit in the original footage, so it is visible
  in every frame, including the poster. The edit adds no NASA logo, title or card. The words are
  Christina Koch's own: nothing was re-ordered or removed except pauses and silence.
- **Fonts:** Anton (bold-pop) and Inter (clean), both SIL OFL, bundled by showtime.
