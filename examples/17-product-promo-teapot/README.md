## The request

> "Make a 20-second square product promo from these museum photos of Christopher Dresser's teapot — sleek, but
> only facts from the museum record. Plus a 6-second bumper."

**Mode:** quick. The video will be published, so a researcher checked the facts and licenses before the build, and a
critic reviewed the final. No questions were asked. The opening line stated the assumptions:

> Quick mode: 20 s square master at 30 fps, plus a 6 s bumper cut down from it; no voice-over. On-screen words
> come only from The Met's record for object 823191. A `lounge-jazz` bed with its final hit on the end card, a
> `thock` on each spec row and a `shimmer` on the turn. Theme `bold`, with its ember accent swapped for silver.
> No Met logo. The end card points to the record, since the teapot is not for sale.

**Contract:** a promo-style film for a museum design object: Dresser's silverplate-and-ebony teapot, dated ca. 1879,
shown in two views and a detail of its stamped marks. It uses only the facts The Met records (date, materials,
size, weight, designer, manufactory) and ends on where to see the record.

### What the research changed in the brief

The researcher's fact sheet corrected the brief before any scene was built, and the film follows the fact sheet:

- **Two views, not "three angles".** The third photo (DP-18258-046) shows the stamped marks on the underside, not a
  view of the teapot. It became the opening image of the maker scene, captioned "Marks on the underside".
- **"Ebony", not "Ebony handle".** The record's medium is "Silverplate, ebony". The word "handle" is not in the record.
- **Hook "ca. 1879.", not "Designed ca. 1879."** The record gives the object's date. It does not give a design date.
- **The record names a manufactory,** James Dixon & Sons. The film names it but gives no founding year, because the
  record gives two different ones.
- **`bold` is ember orange, not silver.** `--accent` is overridden to `#d4d2cf` (13:1 on the ground).

## The story, shot by shot

Each scene starts on a downbeat of the composed bed (108 bpm, one bar = 2.222 s), rounded to the nearest frame, and
each transition is centred on that downbeat (`align center`), so the visible change lands on the beat.

| Time | Scene | On screen | Its job |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0-2.23 s | `hook` | Frame 0 is complete: "TEAPOT" / **"ca. 1879."** above the side-view cut-out, which slides into a warm spotlight pool on a near-black ground | The surprise is the date next to the object. The date is a fact. The picture makes the "it looks modern" point, and no words claim it |
| 2.23-6.67 s | `turn` (sdf-iris, centred on the cut) | The three-quarter view (spout right) on a slow push. A sheen sweeps across the silver, peaking with the `shimmer`. At 3.2 s an original **Lottie** steam curl draws on above the spout | The object from the second side. The steam says "teapot" and makes no claim |
| 6.67-11.1 s | `specs` (slide, centred) | A small side view, then "FROM THE MUSEUM RECORD" and a **feature-grid** spec sheet: Silverplate · Ebony (each labelled "Material", with swatches cut from the photo itself) · 12.7 × 22.9 × 13.3 cm, H × W × D · 500 g, 1.1 lb. A spotlight walks the rows every 1.5 beats, with a `thock` on each, and dims the others to 72 % | The facts, each verbatim from the record |
| 11.1-15.57 s | `maker` (slide, centred) | **Ken-burns** push over the underside (pill: "Marks on the underside") into the stamped facsimile signature and the J D & S marks. Then kinetic type slides in: DESIGNER / **Christopher Dresser** / British, 1834–1904 / Manufactory: James Dixon & Sons, Sheffield | Who made it, introduced by the marks on the object itself |
| 15.57-20 s | `end` (iris, centred) | **End card:** a small three-quarter view, "Teapot, ca. 1879", "The Metropolitan Museum of Art", a "See the record" pill, `metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/823191`, then "Images: The Met, CC0 · Object 2021.153.2 / Museum object; not affiliated with or endorsed by The Met." A second sheen lands on the bed's final hit (17.78 s), with a slow push to the end | Where to see it, plus the credit. There is no sales call to action |

**Bumper (6 s):** the hook (0-1.5 s), the turn with its steam and shimmer (1.5-3.5 s), and a shorter end card
(3.5-6 s: title, museum, credit, no-endorsement line). The bed is re-composed at 120 bpm so both cuts fall on beats,
and both transitions are centred on them. The record URL is left out of the bumper: it could only be read for about
1.2 s there. The master's end card and `share.txt` carry it.

## Iterations that mattered

1. **The bed's grid set the cut list.** At the style's own 112 bpm, with cuts at 3/7/12/16.5 s, the composer
   raised the tempo to 120 and inserted 2-beat bars to land the markers. At 108 bpm a bar is 2.222 s, so the scenes
   were set to whole bars instead: hook 1 bar, then 2 bars each for turn, specs, maker and end. The hook is
   shorter than the brief's 3 s (2.23 s), which fits the story rule that the first cut should come by about 2 s.
2. **End card (check round 1).** The end teapot rendered at its natural 1600 px behind the title, and check reported
   a contrast FAIL (1.21:1 at 16.23 s). It is now sized to 38cqw. "1.1 lb." and the credit line sat in the bottom
   8 % of the frame (the player UI zone), so the rows and the credit moved up.
3. **Sheen.** The first version was a 24 %-wide band at 0.55 alpha that washed out the whole teapot at 3.2 s. It is
   now a 12 % band at 0.42.
4. **One-frame flash at two cuts (final-2 → final-3).** The review pack's `cuts.jpg` showed the bare incoming
   scene (only its label, the grid not yet in) for exactly one frame at 6.667 s and 15.567 s, and then the outgoing
   scene again. Cause: clips snap `data-start` to a frame when it is within 1 ms, but CSS transition windows test
   `t >= start - 1 µs`. So `6.6667` made the clip active at frame 200 while the slide had not started yet. The
   scene starts are now written just below the frame time (`6.6666666`) (see the project's head comment). Neither
   `check` nor `qa` flagged this.
5. **End card motion.** qa noted a 2.6 s final still hold. The end teapot now drifts slowly (scale 1 → 1.06), and
   its sheen peaks on the bed's final hit at 17.78 s.
6. **Maker pill (critic polish, final-3 → final-5).** "Marks on the underside" covered the top of the registration
   diamond as the push rose. The push now ends 9 % to the right, and the pill leaves at 13.65-14.0 s, before the
   diamond reaches it. In the post-ship polish (item 7) the fade moved to 13.5-13.85 s.
7. **Post-ship polish (final-5 → final-6, bumper).** A second critic pass found the visible transitions
   starting 0.11-0.23 s after the downbeats their scenes start on (the iris ring first showed at 2.40 s for a
   2.233 s cut). All four transitions are now centred on their cut (`data-transition="slide left 0.6 center"`), so
   each is mid-way on the beat; the scene starts, SFX and bed did not move. Centring moved `check`'s sample times,
   and it then caught two things the old samples had missed: the dimmed "Ebony" row's label was 3.74:1 at 10.0 s
   (the rows now dim to 72 %, not 55 %), and the manufactory line lost 0.3 s of readable time to the earlier iris
   (it now fades in at 12.9 s, not 13.2 s). The row labels read "Material", not "Medium", which a stranger could read
   as a size. The bumper drops the record URL (see above).

## Review

No sub-agent tool was available in this session, so the maker answered the critic brief itself. Round 1
([`review/round-1-FINDINGS.md`](review/round-1-FINDINGS.md), on final-3) gave "ship after fixes": no blockers, no
should-fixes, and one polish item (the pill overlap), which is fixed. Round 2 ([`review/round-2-FINDINGS.md`](review/round-2-FINDINGS.md), on
final-5) checked the fix and gave "ship". Every on-screen word was checked against the researcher's allowed-wording list.
After "ship", a second critic pass on final-5 (with the bumper seen through ffmpeg frames) found no blockers, one
should-fix (the bumper's URL was readable for only ~1.2 s) and four polish notes: transitions lagging the downbeats,
the pill's last opaque frames ~9 px from the diamond, "Medium" readable as a size, and a one-frame iris artefact in the
bumper. The first three and the should-fix are done (iteration 7). The iris artefact is normal iris geometry and is
left as is. Each fix was checked with before/after snaps at the cited times. The bumper then got its own review pack,
answered as a self-review ("ship"). That pass also noted that review-pack's `cuts.jpg` samples around `data-start`
(-2f..+4f) and so can miss transitions that start later; with the transitions now centred, the bumper's `cuts.jpg`
shows them mid-way.
A human look and a listen are still welcome, because this session can meter audio but cannot hear it.
